# Code-Convert

The Code-Convert is a React-based web application that is powered by the OpenAPI to help users convert code snippets into different programming languages, comment out code snippets, or explain what the code will accomplish.

## Features

The Code-Convert App provides the following features:

### Translate Code

The app allows users to translate code from one programming language to another. To use this feature, the user enters the code snippet they want to translate and selects the target programming language from the dropdown menu. The app then uses the OpenAPI to translate the code and displays the translated code in a new text area.

### Comment Code

The app allows users to comment out code snippets, with comments explaining what each line of code does. To use this feature, the user enters the code snippet they want to comment out and clicks the "Comment" button. The app then uses the OpenAPI to comment out the code and displays the commented code in a new text area.

### Explain Code

The app allows users to get an explanation of what a code snippet does. To use this feature, the user enters the code snippet they want to explain and clicks the "Explain" button. The app then uses the OpenAPI to analyze the code and provides a brief explanation of what the code does.
